        <h1>Challenge</h1>

        <div class="credit">Proposed by Marian Veteanu</div>

        <p>
            I hope you liked the <a href="https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/alien-invaders/" target="_blank">previous week's recreational coding challenge</a>!
            I hope you found it fun and refreshing. This week we are proposing a similar challenge.
            If you have time please try to implement it, so we can gave a real game jam!
        </p>

        <p>
            In this coding challenge you continue your journey of game dev wannabe, and plan to produce and release a
            clone of the classical game <b>"Snake"</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, as a timid player in this space, you’ll probably want to work on this challenge on a Friday
            evening, and then share with your close colleagues first, for feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, you plan to write the game using only HTML / JavaScript, on an 800x600 Canvas element.
        <p>

            <br>
        <p>
            The game mechanics are pretty simple:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You have to direct a small snake of 1 unit on the a grid-like system on top of a Canvas (everything on
                this screen will be represented on this grid).</li>
            <li>The snake slithers automatically at a certain speed, without pressing any key. Pressing arrow keys makes
                the snake change direction appropriately.</li>
            <li>A random piece of food appears on the screen.</li>
            <li>Each time the snakes eats the food, it grows with 1 unit.</li>
            <li>You need to avoid crashing into walls, as well as into itself (this becomes more and more challenging,
            as the snake grows).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
            For you as a developer, this game poses 3 challenges:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>How to implement the snake? (<b>Hint</b>: arrays)</li>
            <li>How to grow the snake after eating food? (<b>Hint</b>: the snake grows at the <b>head</b>, not at the
                tail)</li>
            <li>How to work with the canvas and game loop? (<b>Hint</b>: see <a
                    href="https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/alien-invaders/" target="_blank">last week's challenge</a>)</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <p class="blue">Good luck, and enjoy!!</p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> After you finish the coding, show the game to your kids or family… See what they think about
            it! Seek their opinion on how to improve the game mechanics or graphics!
