Tribute to early arcade games such as Snake.

Shows the game loop pattern, together with keyboard event handling, game state, rendering, etc. Implemented using HTML5, JavaScript, and canvas-based painting.

This was intense! Difficulty wise, itâ€™s a few notches above regular challenges, but still mega fun!  
I **loved** building the game, and playing the game.

My personal best score was `22,360` with a snake length of `57` pieces.  
Try to beat it... but beware, itâ€™s addictive ðŸ˜Ž!

By the way, the food is hard to get when itâ€™s at the marginsâ€¦ so you get 10x more points.
    
And itâ€™s almost impossible to get, when itâ€™s in a cornerâ€¦ so you get 100x more points (so far, I crashed every single time in that situationâ€¦ if you find a trick that works, please let me know).

Also on first try the game looked a bit dull, so I took a few "artistic" liberties regarding background, shapes, colors, and even sounds. I hope youâ€™ll like it.

**PS**: to adjust the snakeâ€™s speed, change the following line of code in the Gameâ€™s constructor:
> `this.pixelsPerSecond = 250;`

Decrease the number to slow-down the snake, or vice-versa.
